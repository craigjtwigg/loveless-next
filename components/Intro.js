        Suff Studio is a purpose built recording studio in Lancashire, run by me
        - Matt Heap, a producer, musician, recording and mix engineer with over
        10 years experience recording music across multiple genres from
        metalcore through to folk music. I also play guitar and sing in the
        shoegaze/grunge band Honeyspider and am an active function musician
        playing bass, guitar and vocals. My musician and songwriting skills
        allow me not only to record your music but lend a fine ear to the
        details of the song itself. ​</p>
        
        <p>
          As a producer I encourage you to
        experiment with sounds, layers and harmonies while I experiment with
        various recording techniques and equipment selection to accomplish an
        intricate and massive sound. This means that you will leave the studio
        with recordings that are totally unique to you and go beyond the
        original bones of what you came to the studio with. ​ </p>

        Most importantly,
        I put the needs and tastes of each artist before my own and work with
        them to achieve the sound that suits their own original music, adding my
        own spin when requested. The bands and artists I have worked with have
        been featured on major radio shows such as Radio One Rock Show, BBC
        Introducing, Xfm and Radio X as well as many official spotify playlists.
        They have been featured at festivals such as Kendal Calling, Isle of
        White Festival, Arctangent, Download Festival, Slam Dunk, 2000 Trees,
        Beat-herder and many more, whilest touring the world. Labels I have
        worked with include Sony Records, Music For Nations, Society Of Losers &
        Scyla.
