        Suff Studio is a purpose built recording studio in Lancashire, run by me
        - Matt Heap, a producer, musician, recording and mix engineer with over
        10 years experience recording music across multiple genres from
        metalcore through to folk music. I also play guitar and sing in the
        shoegaze/grunge band Honeyspider and am an active function musician
        playing bass, guitar and vocals. My musician and songwriting skills
        allow me not only to record your music but lend a fine ear to the
        details of the song itself. â€‹
